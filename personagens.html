                <li>Chieftain</li>
                <span>The Chieftain is a fire oriented Ascendancy class that has a good mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. The Chieftain Ascendancy offers support to fire damage builds, fire damage over time builds, strike and slam skills, strength stacking, warcry skills, totem skills, and explode capabilities. Furthermore, all of his minor passives grant life regeneration, bolstering life sustain.
                </span>
                <li>Trickster</li>
                <span>The Trickster is a versatile defensive class focused around evasion and energy shield-related defenses, strong recovery, and generic damage bonuses. The Trickster gains added layers of defence to his evasion and energy shield from Escape Artist, which they can further augment with leech with Soul Drinker, or spell suppression and energy shield recharge with Spellbreaker.
                </span>
                <li>Hierophant</li>
                <span>The Hierophant offers a mixture of non-conventional sources of damage, defenses, and overall utility aimed towards spell users, particularly spell casting totems and brands. They can utilize a large mana pool effectively by converting it to offensive and defensive bonuses while also conserving and regenerating it.
