            The Chieftain is a fire oriented Ascendancy class that has a good
            mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. The Chieftain
            Ascendancy offers support to fire damage builds, fire damage over
            time builds, strike and slam skills, strength stacking, warcry
            skills, totem skills, and explode capabilities. Furthermore, all of
            his minor passives grant life regeneration, bolstering life sustain.

          <dd>
            The Trickster is a versatile defensive class focused around evasion
            and energy shield-related defenses, strong recovery, and generic
            damage bonuses. The Trickster gains added layers of defence to his
            evasion and energy shield from Escape Artist, which they can further
            augment with leech with Soul Drinker, or spell suppression and
            energy shield recharge with Spellbreaker.

          <dt>Hierophant</dt>
          <dd>
            The Hierophant offers a mixture of non-conventional sources of
            damage, defenses, and overall utility aimed towards spell users,
            particularly spell casting totems and brands. They can utilize a
            large mana pool effectively by converting it to offensive and
            defensive bonuses while also conserving and regenerating it.
